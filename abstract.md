# Implementing and Evaluating News Recommender Systems to Optimize User Experience in graphworks.ai

Graphworks.ai, an innovative platform, leverages advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies to analyze a multitude of news articles from the World Wide Web daily, aiming to unveil insights into supply chain risks and sales opportunities. However, the increasing flow of analyzed articles overwhelms users, causing issues like information and cognitive overload as they struggle to identify the most relevant articles that meet their specific needs.

In this thesis, our objective is to enhance the user experience on the Graphworks.ai platform by implementing and evaluating existing state-of-the-art recommender systems from the literature. The initiative seeks to facilitate a more refined and user-focused presentation of articles, aiding users in easily discovering content that aligns with their interests and requirements. Initially, an in-depth review of current literature will be undertaken, complemented by an empirical analysis of various news platforms, to ascertain the most effective interface for capturing user feedback on suggested articles, such as through like and dislike buttons.

Subsequently, we will adopt and tailor selected recommender systems that align with the identified interface, striving for an integration that amplifies the platform’s usability and user engagement. A comprehensive user study employing a between-subjects design will be carried out to gauge the effectiveness of the implemented recommender systems in improving user satisfaction and engagement. The study aims to unveil which recommender system best enhances the user’s ability to effortlessly and accurately select news articles that are most congruent with their individual preferences and needs.
