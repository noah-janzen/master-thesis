- Problem statement

  - graphworks.ai is web application that provides insights on business risks as well as sales opportunities based on news articles analyzed by artifical intelligence techniques
  - graphworks is used by professional clients, e.g. sales employees to identify sales chances and procurements employees to analyze potentials issues in their supply chain
  - news articles are scraped every two hours on the world wide web
  - the analyzed news articles are displayed in a list, sorted by their date published, so that the latest article appears on top
  - the increasing number of news articles overwhelms users, causing issues like information and cognitive overload as they struggle to identify the most relevant articles that meet their specific needs

- Objective

  - the objective is to enhance the user experience on the graphworks.ai web app by implementing an existing state-of-the-art adaptive news recommender system
    - the users should be able to discover content that aligns with their interest and requirements more easily
    - the users should be able to provide explicit and implicit feedback on suggested news articles and the recommender system should be able to utilize this feedback instantly to provide more refined recommendations in the future (adaptive recommender)

- Approach
  - Initially, an in-depth review of current literature will be undertaken, complemented by an epirical analysis of various news platforms, to ascertain the most effective interface for capturing user feedback on suggested articles (e.g. like/dislike buttons)
  - Subsequently, adaptive, state-of-the-art news recommender systems that align with the previously identified feedback interface will be identified. The most accurate recommender will be implemented in graphworks
  - A user study employing a between-subjects design will be carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented recommender systems by measuring the usability using the proven System Usability Scale questionaire
  - The best performing recommender should be employed permantently in the productive system of graphworks.ai in order improve the user experience and mitigate the overload issues
